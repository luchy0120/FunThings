Criterion for Euler Paths: Two ends has odd number edges, other vertices have 
even number edges
Criterion for Euler Circuits: All vertices have even number edges

Handshaking theorem : d1+d2+d3+...dn = 2*e , dn stands for degree of vertice n,
thus, a graph without self loop has even number of odd vertices


Removing a single edge from a connected graph can make it
disconnected.  Such an edge is called a bridge


Fleuryâ€™s Algorithm:

To find an Euler path or an Euler circuit:
1.  Make sure the graph has either 0 or 2 odd vertices.
2.  If there are 0 odd vertices, start anywhere.  If there are 2
odd vertices, start at one of them.
3.  Follow edges one at a time.  If you have a choice between
a bridge and a non-bridge, always choose the non-bridge.
4.  Stop when you run out of edges
